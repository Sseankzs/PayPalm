## How It Works
1. Merchant app sends a request to the Pi server (/register or /scanPalm).

2. Pi opens the camera and runs capture.py to scan a QR and/or palm.

3. The image is processed using an ONNX model (e.g. MediaPipe or YOLOv4).

4. Data is sent to the main Flask cloud server for registration or payment verification.

5. Server sends back result (success/failure).
